# WICS-Hackathon-Project

## Description

Our project consists of a home page and an internship finder. The home page contains links to statistics about underrepresented groups in tech, and the internship finder uses both user input and our pre-set keywords to find internships on Indeed that place emphasis on underrepresented groups.

## Our vision

The goal of our project was to create something both informative and useful for underrepresented groups in tech. Since most of us are part of these groups, we brainstormed what would be useful to break into the tech field from our perspectives. The informative section represents our desire to both educate others and learn more about underrepresented groups' standing in the tech field. The internship finder is meant to increase diversity in the field by helping people of these groups start their tech careers.

## How to install and run the project


## How to use the project

The first thing you will see is the homepage, which contains a navigation bar with the "Home" and "About" buttons, as well as the "Internship Finder" button in the center of the page. On the navigation bar, the "About" button takes you to a page with statistics, and the "Home" button takes you back to the first page. 

The "Internship Finder" button takes you to the internship finder, where you are prompted to either search for your desired career or click the "Find Opportunities!" button, which has "software engineer" as the default career. A new Chrome window will pop up, and the internship finder will look through the internships on Indeed for your career and our pre-set keywords. When it is finished, the Chrome window closes, and several internships with their corresponding Indeed links will appear. Clicking "Find More" will repeat this process.
